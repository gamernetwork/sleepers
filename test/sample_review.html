<p>Doom has moved on. id Software's new take on its old classic
once again straddles a fault-line between the partly colonised
surface of Mars and a rollicking Death Metal album cover version of
Hell, all goat motifs and bubbling plumes of gore. Brought to life
with staggering detail, it's a world away from the sprites and
vertices of John Carmack's original Doom engine, but each chapter
does feature a secret area modelled on one of Doom or Doom 2's
maps, nestled inside this assured, muscular reboot like a vestigial
organ.</p>

<p>Venturing into them prompts confused emotions. The whirling
volcanic beauty of id Tech 6 evaporates and you are bathed in the
harsh, static glare of forgotten pixels. Walls lose their sheen.
Shadows harden into blades. Barrels flatten to muddy thumbprints.
Lava flows are reduced to flickering mosaics. At first it's as
charming as finding a long-lost comic book underneath your bed, but
you are an intruder here, able to jump and climb (blasphemy!) where
the original Doom's marine could only sprint and strafe, the
sumptuous 3D gun in your hand rudely interrupting the illusion of
having travelled back to 1993.</p>
<p>This is an all-new Doom, and it turns out we should be thankful
for that. If id's reboot has spent nearly a decade languishing in
limbo, the single player offers up little evidence of all that
strife and sorrow. This is one of the most generous and frenetic
shooter campaigns in years, a blend of cleverly layered arena
battles and exploration spiced with free-running that owes as much
to Quake, Painkiller and Metroid Prime as it does the false
partitions and keycards of the original game.</p>
<p>As a work of architecture, the new Doom lacks the delicacy of
its unhallowed predecessors: the maps are broken up more obviously
into killboxes, often centring on the evisceration (literally) of a
demon "Gore Nest" that triggers a wave of spawns, and their moving
parts and secret routes are less surprising. There's also a leaden,
retrieve-the-McGuffin storyline that very infrequently insists on
pegging you down while an NPC acts out, and skulking to the rear,
the charisma-deficient multiplayer. But on the whole this is as
successful a restoration project as you could hope for, a revival
that cherishes its heritage but also understands that the older
games have had their day.</p>

<p class="caption">The remade classic maps feature enemies from the
new game. Lost souls, indeed.</p>
</div>
<p>Consider the reworked controls and how they structure your
access to the arsenal, with seeming reference to, of all genres,
the Capcom-brand third-person brawler. In arranging the campaign
around free-wheeling wave battles, id has realised that
responsiveness and clarity are key, so you can only switch between
two primary weapons in real time, after picking them from a
Dishonored-style radial menu that plunges the action into slow
motion. Once acquired, the chainsaw and legendary BFG are mapped to
square and triangle, so you're never further than a single,
cathartic button-press from either an always-lethal melee attack or
a screen-clearing smartbomb. The chainsaw also doubles as a
resourcing tool, carving both flesh and ammunition from the fallen;
this goes hand in hand with new Glory Kill finishers, which see you
pounding or ripping health refills from staggered, flashing
opponents.</p>
<p>When the heat is on, these abilities and mechanics create a
rhythm of advance and evasion that's straight out of Devil May Cry,
though it's hardly as intricate. You'll scuttle around the
perimeter, allowing the terrain's involutions to guide you to item
drops and jump pads as you crash through low-level resistance,
swivelling at intervals to pull something's arms off or pummel less
agile demons with rockets. On higher difficulties, brinkmanship is
everything - can you land a Glory Kill on that fallen Mancubus and
top up your vitality before a nearby Hell Knight stomps you? Having
a maximum of two guns in hand at once, meanwhile, encourages you to
work out which weapons complement each other in certain scenarios.
The chaingun savages clumps of possessed humans, for example, but
is slow to spin up till you unlock one of its mods, so pairing it
off with a combat shotgun is advisable.</p>
<p>The new weapon mods (mapped to L2) are immensely gratifying to
fool around with - be it the assault rifle's cute yet murderous
flocks of micromissiles or the Gauss rifle's Siege mode, which
roots you on the spot for an apocalyptic damage buff. Unlocking
their most powerful traits lends the combat its upper layer of
complexity and challenge - rather than merely spending the Weapon
Points the campaign hands out like candy, you'll need to fulfil
more demanding criteria such as stunning, then slaughtering several
demons at once with the Plasma Rifle's concussion blast. But the
real value of mods is simply that you'll need to look for them.</p>
<aside class="">
<h2>Snapchat</h2>
<a href="#" class="toggle"></a>
<div>
<p>Doom comes with a SnapMap editor that can be used to create
levels for solo, co-operative and competitive play. On the strength
of a few hours' fiddling, it's a robust and reasonably
laymen-friendly tool, though you'll definitely fare better if you
know what a Boolean number is and why command strings are useful.
Rooms are bolted together on a blueprint screen, then populated
with objects, enemies and variables in first person, till you run
out of memory. Community and developer creations so far run the
gamut from Horde Mode rip-offs through arcade racing to slowburn
survival horror. Given that Doom will apparently receive no single
player DLC, this could be a godsend for people who fall in love
with the campaign.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Each is the jealously guarded property of a robot drone, some of
which hover on the main path through each level, while most are
tucked away in the crannies. Obtaining them all means keeping one
eye forever peeled for movable vent panels, interactive terminals,
sidepaths that wind marginally out of sight above or below
walkways, and the green light fittings that betray objects you can
climb on. When you do reach the prize, Doomguy tears it from the
drone's claws and administers a corrective thump for good measure.
It's both an amusing piece of characterisation and a cruel joke
about id's adoption of ideas from role-playing shooters. This isn't
learning from your peers - it's mugging them.</p>
<div class="illustration" style="width: 600px"><img src=

<p class="caption">The BFG's projectile zaps anything nearby till
it hits something - for best results, aim at an enemy across the

</div>
<p>Mods aren't the only treasures buried in the wilderness. There
are also tokens with which to upgrade your Praetor suit, dinky
Doomguy marionettes, challenge rooms that bestow stat-amplifying
Runes, energy orbs that raise your max health, armour or
ammunition, and a few more exotic, fan-pleasing trinkets I won't
spoil. Each environment is a toybox begging to be plundered,
generally as tall as it is wide, though the aesthetic sometimes
fails to engage your curiosity. Doom is a technical behemoth that
may send your PS4 fan into overdrive, but there are only so many
poorly-lit corridors, loading bays and windblown dunes one can
stomach. Things do pick up when you reach Hell, however, with its
navigable asteroid fields and ravaged vistas of bone and offal.</p>
<p>Nowhere is id's artful re-engineering of Doom's DNA more
apparent than in the denizens of the underworld. Certain of the
fallen angels are straight updates - Lost Souls are still kamikaze
bombers, especially bothersome during platform sections, and the
Cacodemon is still a bloated, grinning tumour with a stomachful of
acid - but most have been reinvented, generally with the vertical
axis in mind. The Imp no longer wobbles about pugnaciously at a
distance but scuttles across the layout, lobbing fireballs while
dangling from a claw and rushing you when your back is turned. The
Pinky is a squealing battering ram that's seriously bad news in the
catacombs, resilient against frontal fire but with a soft, spongy
rear.</p>
<p>Hell Knights and Barons are now able to perform ground pound
attacks, so permitting them a height advantage is deeply unwise.
Speaking of which, the gawky, gaping Revenant can boost skywards to
unleash a missile barrage. The Archville now teleports, twitching
out of harm's way in mimicry of Halo 4's Promethean Knights, in
addition to conjuring up other demons. Mix four or more of these
creature varieties together and you've got a firefight that's the
equal of anything in Destiny. And then there are the bosses, which
again take concepts from the original games in fresh directions.
I'll leave you to make your own introductions.</p>
<p>The same is true of at least one of the multiplayer modes,
Warpath, which blows what you think you know about King of the Hill
out the airlock by having the hill move around the map, slopping up
walls and cruising through chokepoints while players jockey for
possession. The hill's route is clearly marked, so the first
question in an attacker's head on respawn is usually whether to
chase it or lie in wait; defensive play, conversely, comes down to
having somebody in the zone at all times while everybody else keeps
their distance for fear of an ambush. It's a fantastic way of
teaching you the uses and abuses of the layout, and the
multiplayer's only truly memorable flourish.</p>

</div>
<p>Warpath aside, the offerings consist of vanilla team deathmatch,
objective capture, and a variation on the Kill Confirmed archetype
with souls to collect for points instead of dogtags. Freeze Tag is
a little more worthy of discussion: it's Team Deathmatch, but
weapons turn opponents to blocks of ice rather than slaying them
outright. Frozen players can be thawed out by comrades, which
creates some hectic clutch moments when a sole survivor brings a
team back from the brink; they can also be treated as cover,
shunted around or aggressively danced at, because nothing says
"camaraderie" like doing the Charleston when the chips are
down.</p>

<p>Backing all this up is a set of loadout options, time-limited
perks (activated before respawning, as with Titanfall's Burn Cards)
and "personalisation" features that couldn't be more flavourless if
they were physically wrung from Call of Duty's sagging boxers. It's
pure and unapologetic bandwagon-jumping, thankfully quarantined
from the rest of the game - you're actually required to reload the
whole thing if you want to access multiplayer or Doom's SnapMap
level editor. The recycling might be forgivable if the shooting
were spot-on, but the guns feel like poor cousins of their
magnificent counterparts in single player: splash damage is weirdly
miserly and scopes are pushed to the fore. A shade more excitingly,
there's a map power-up that transforms you briefly into one of the
demons from the campaign, but it's little more than a glorified
streak reward in practice, with no modes on offer that make direct
use of it.</p>
<p>Save for Warpath, then, the multiplayer is a malnourished
appendage, grafted on for the sake of feature parity with the
reigning champions of the genre Doom created. But that isn't enough
to sully the campaign's lustre. Capacious, beautiful, brainy and
barbaric, Doom's return could be this year's most unexpected
triumph, largely because it's the work of people who understand
that every reboot is a work of both love and hatred, in which
creators fight against the pull of the subject matter. It's not
enough to summon and confront the devil. You also have to exorcise
the creature, to put the past firmly in its place. The Doom of 2016
hasn't rendered the Doom of 1993 surplus to requirements - that
would take sorcery indeed - but id has finally managed to escape
its gravity.</p>
